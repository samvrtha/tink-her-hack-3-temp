### Project Description
UniQuest is a college information platform that helps students explore and compare colleges based on location, courses offered, fees, rankings, and facilities. With a user-friendly search feature, it provides easy access to essential details and direct website links, simplifying the decision-making process for students.
### The Problem statement
Kerala’s 12th-grade students struggle to find reliable, up-to-date college information, making selection overwhelming. With thousands of options, comparing courses, fees, facilities, and reputation is difficult due to the lack of a centralized platform. This leads to confusion, uncertainty, and missed opportunities. A solution is needed to simplify the process by providing accurate, accessible, and personalized information, helping students make confident, well-informed decisions about their future.
### The Solution
We are developing a college information website that helps students explore colleges, view detailed information, and contribute suggestions to improve the database. Using Flask, MySQL, and frontend technologies, we built a dynamic and user-friendly platform that allows easy access to college details. Instead of strictly dividing tasks, we worked collaboratively, sharing responsibilities across backend, frontend, and project management to ensure smooth integration and efficient development. Our goal is to create a centralized, interactive, and scalable platform that makes the college selection process easier and more informative for students.

### Project Documentation
For Software: UNIQUEST – College Information Portal is a web-based platform designed to simplify college selection for Kerala’s 12th-grade students by offering centralized, accurate information. Addressing the lack of reliable resources, it enables users to search/filter colleges by name, location, fees, ranking, and facilities, with detailed profiles covering courses, fees, websites, and infrastructure. Built with **Flask (Python)** for backend logic, **MySQL** for data storage, and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for responsive frontend, the project follows a phased implementation: research, development, testing, and deployment. Future enhancements include user reviews, AI-driven chatbots, and scholarship integration. Team roles include backend/frontend developers and a project manager ensuring seamless feature execution and data accuracy.
